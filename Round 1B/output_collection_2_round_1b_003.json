      "refined_text": "You can create PDFs from documents printed on paper, Microsoft Word documents, InDesign® files, digital images, and more. Diﬀerent types of sources have diﬀerent tools available for PDF conversion. In many applications, you can create PDFs by selecting the Adobe PDF printer in the Print dialog box. If a file is open in its authoring application (such as a spreadsheet that is open in Microsoft Excel), you can convert it to PDF without opening Adobe Acrobat. Similarly, if Acrobat is already open, you don’t have to open the authoring application to convert a file to PDF. Every PDF balances eﬃciency (small file size) and quality (such as resolution and color). If the balance between the file size and the quality is critical to your task, you must use an appropriate conversion method. For example, you can drag files to the Acrobat icon to create PDFs. In this case, Acrobat applies the most recently used conversion settings without providing access to those settings. If you want more control over the process, you’ll want to use another method."

The original file is not modified. Instead, Acrobat creates an autosave file of changes, which includes all the changes you made to the open file since the last automatic save. The amount of new information that the autosave file contains depends on how frequently Acrobat saves the autosave file. If you set the autosave interval to 15 minutes, you could lose the last 14 minutes of your work if a problem occurs. Frequent automatic saving prevents loss of data, and is especially useful if you make extensive changes to a document, such as by adding comments. You can apply autosave changes to the original files when you restart Acrobat. When you close, save manually, or revert to the last-saved version of a file, the autosave file is deleted."

      "refined_text": "Overview of generative AI features Use the generative AI features in Acrobat and Acrobat Reader to quickly scan through lengthy, complex PDF content and get answers or generate a summary. Note: The generative AI features in Acrobat and Acrobat Reader support English, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, or Japanese. To understand the governing terms, review Adobe's Generative AI User Guidelines. To understand Adobe's data handling practices, see Content usage and handling practices. The AI-powered features in Acrobat and Acrobat Reader support multiple document types, including PDFs, DOCX, PPTX, TXT, and RTF files. AI Assistant supports Microsoft Teams and Zoom meeting transcripts. The capabilities improve comprehension and save time across various document types. AI Assistant quickly gets answers to your questions based on your documents in a comprehensive and informative way. It can analyze multiple documents to uncover similarities, differences, and key patterns. With AI Assistant, you can make targeted requests, such as highlighting the differences between PDF contracts. It links to text and data table sources within the document. It also suggests follow-up questions for you based on the primary question. AI Assistant uses the latest AI language model, GPT 4o, to provide more accurate and clear answers to your queries based on more citations. It can extract information accurately from tables and complex documents. Generative summary automatically provides an outline with headings and summaries to highlight key points in the document. The feature generates key insights that help you easily comprehend the PDF content. For a speedier response, it processes PDF content in chunks and simultaneously streams summaries. You can access the generative AI features in Adobe Acrobat Reader, Adobe Acrobat desktop on both Windows and macOS, on Acrobat online, and within Acrobat extensions for Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge. AI Assistant is also available on phones through Acrobat mobile apps (iOS and Android). It isn't available on iPad or Android tablets. Benefits of generative AI features The generative AI features in Acrobat and Acrobat Reader significantly improve comprehension, help you get insights, and produce high-quality content quickly. Here are the main benefits. - Improved comprehension: You can better understand complex PDF documents because the features provide insights and more context around the content. - Enhanced productivity : Work across multiple PDFs and documents in various formats, including Teams and Zoom meeting transcripts, streamlining your workflow and saving time for higher-priority tasks. - Impactful content : You can use the content suggestions that the features generate for impactful emails, presentations, meeting notes, and more. Turn off generative AI features The generative AI features in Acrobat and Acrobat Reader are turned on by default. However, you can choose to turn them off, if necessary. If you're an admin, you can revoke access to generative AI features for your team or org by contacting Adobe Customer Care. User Guidelines User Guidelines governing your access and use of Acrobat and Acrobat Reader generative AI features are found here. In addition, please always use your judgment to evaluate generated output and any source attributions. Acrobat and Acrobat Reader generative AI features are built upon powerful, emerging large language model technologies that may generate outputs that are inaccurate or misleading, or otherwise reflect content that does not represent Adobe’s views. This is especially true if you try to use these features to generate outputs that are unrelated to your source document. Do not use generative AI features to seek legal, medical, financial, or other kinds of professional advice or any opinions, judgments, or recommendations without conducting your own independent consultation or research. Generative AI features cannot replace advice provided by a qualified professional and do not form any such relationship (for example, an attorney-client relationship)."

      "section_title": "Attributions",
      "refined_text": "When the AI Assistant analyzes a document, it identifies sentences most likely to support the answer to your question. Attribution can take the form of clickable citations or other helpful cues indicating where generated information came from. However, because the AI Assistant is powered by generative AI models, and the technology is still evolving and not perfect, not all answers are helpful or accurate. As a result, the AI Assistant may not find and display answers to your questions — even when the information is in your document. And rarely, the AI Assistant may provide incorrect attributions. For example, you may receive a clickable citation or cue that takes you to an unrelated section instead of providing helpful information on where the answer came from in the document. Please double-check all AI-generated responses. Please note that in our current version, if the language of the question and response is different than the language of your document, AI Assistant won't provide any attribution. In such scenarios, you can try asking questions in the language of the document to receive clickable citations in the response."

Unlike a handwritten signature, a certificate-based signature is difficult to forge because it contains encrypted information that is unique to the signer. It can be easily verified and informs recipients whether the document was modified after the signer initially signed it. To sign a document with a certificate-based signature, you must obtain a digital ID or create a self-signed digital ID in Acrobat or Acrobat Reader . The digital ID contains a private key and a certificate with a public key, and more. The private key is used to create the certificate-based signature. The certificate is a credential that is automatically applied to the signed document. The signature is verified when recipients open the document. When you apply a certificate-based signature, Acrobat uses a hashing algorithm to generate a message digest, which it encrypts using your private key.

To verify authenticity, the validator checks if the signer's certificate or its parent certificates are trusted.

For example, a government agency creates a form with signature fields and certifies it, allowing users to only change form fields and sign the document. Removing pages or adding comments will result in losing the certified status. A certifying signature can only be applied if the PDF has no other signatures. These signatures can be visible or invisible, and a blue ribbon icon in the Signatures panel confirms a valid certifying signature. Adding a certifying digital signature requires a digital ID."

      "refined_text": "Long-term signature validation allows you to verify the signature's validity long after the document was signed. To achieve this, all the necessary elements for signature validation must be embedded in the signed PDF. These elements can be embedded during the document signing process or added afterward. If certain information is not included in the PDF, the signature can only be validated for a limited time because certificates related to the signature eventually expire or are revoked. When a certificate expires, the issuing authority is no longer responsible for providing revocation status, rendering the signature unverifiable. The necessary elements for signature validity include the signing certificate chain, certificate revocation status, and possibly a timestamp. If these elements are embedded during signing, the signature can be validated without requiring external resources. Acrobat and Acrobat Reader can embed the necessary elements if available, and the PDF creator must enable usage rights for Acrobat Reader users by going to the hamburger menu (Windows) or the Acrobat menu (macOS) > Save as other > Acrobat Reader extended PDF . Note: Embedding timestamp information requires an appropriately configured timestamp server. In addition, the signature validation time must be set to Secure Time by navigating to Preferences > Security > Advanced Preferences > Verification tab. CDS certificates can add verification information, such as revocation and timestamp into the document without requiring any configuration from the signer. However, the signer must be online to fetch the appropriate information."
